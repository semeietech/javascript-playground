In the very beging of your journey a bunch of paths shoud be presented to you. But How to know what path lead to the truth?

## The thing is all about `true` or `false`.

In javascript we have a bunch of types of data, as in `number`, `string`, `object`, but a very special and important one is the boolean type, the true or false value.

In pratice, every variable in javascript can represent true or false.

Try this on your console:
```javascript
var numberTen = 10;
var stringTen = '10';
var stringEmpty = '';
var object = {
    foo: numberTen,
    bar: stringTen,
    baz: stringEmpty,
}
```

For this first chalenge we want a function who can test if the value passed for it is true or false.
```javascript
// something like that, please give a better name for your function than me
functionBool(numberTen) => `javascript aswer`
funtionBoll(stringTen) => `javascript aswer`
```

Some questions for after resolution:

- what is the diference betwen `===`, `==` and `=`?
- Do you tried your function with one of thus variations?
- Do you tested your function with other values?
- Could we do this function with less code?
- Could we do not even use this function and get the same result?
- How?


Please, keep all your function version on the js file for further studies.
