A bunch of exercises for javascript beginers

## How to use this
First of all, have a good mentor for helping with some of the tricks assignment.
A good way of took this path is to have a partner with the same level, so 2 beginers and someone more expert.

Every session teach something, and chalenge you to use this knoledge. A bunch of time a previus solutions is a step for the actual solution, so dont skip any challenge.

Every one take this challenge shoud fork this repo and put a js file side by side of the md and the html file of the chalenge. Please do not send anything for this repo, we should keep it just for the challenges it self, not the solutions.

Please fell free to send pull request with new chalengers.
